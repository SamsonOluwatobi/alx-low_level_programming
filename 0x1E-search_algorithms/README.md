# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

## Learning Objectives

- Implement linear search
- Implement binary search
- Understand when to use each algorithm


`linear_search.c` is an implementation of the linear search algorithm. It takes an array and a target value as input and returns the index of the target value in the array. If the target value is not in the array, it returns -1.

`binary_search.c` is an implementation of the binary search algorithm. It takes a sorted array and a target value as input and returns the index of the target value in the array. If the target value is not in the array, it returns -1.

The best search algorithm to use depends on the size of the array and the characteristics of the data. Linear search is simple and works well for small arrays, while binary search is faster for large sorted arrays.
